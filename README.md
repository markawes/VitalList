# VitalList
A open source Discord bot list that I made at 1 AM.

## Setting it up

After you have all the files, make a .env file an imput the secrets.
```
token=
stoken=
mongo=
secret=
```

## Starting the project
Simply run the project with:
``npm start``

We recommend using the below srcipt to use when changing it:
``npm run start:dev``

This will use nodemon on vs code and others.
